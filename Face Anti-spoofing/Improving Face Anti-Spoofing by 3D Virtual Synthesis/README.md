## Improving Face Anti-Spoofing by 3D Virtual Synthesis

- A virtual synthesis method to generate bent and out-of-plane rotated spoofs is proposed.
- First these synthetic images are generated through rendering from transformed mess in 3D space.
- DCNNs are trained on these  synthetic data using a data balancing method to improvise generalisation of face anti spoofing models.
- Experiments are designed in 2 aspects : Intra database(CASIS-MFSD and Replay-Attack) and Inter database(training on CaSIA-MFSD and testing on CASIS-RFS).
- Datasets used - CASIA-MFSD,CASIA-RFS and Replay-Attack.
