## Domain Adaptation in Multi-Channel Autoencoder based Features for Robust Face Anti-Spoofing

[International Conference on Biometrics 2019]

-  A novel deep-learning based
MC face PAD algorithm is  introduced, having a CNN-like
structure composed of a set of MC encoders and an MLP.
- Instead of collecting more training data, the domain
adaptation technique is proposed, transferring the knowledge of facial appearance from RGB to multi-channel domain. Domain adaptation is done via autoencoders, which
are first pre-trained on a large publicly available RGB face
database, and are then partially fine-tuned on the set of BWNIR-D face images.
- We demonstrate, that learning
the features of individual facial regions, is more discriminative than the features learned from an entire face. Proposed
MC face PAD method gives very promising results, significantly outperforming hand-crafted features based baseline,
on the challenging database, namely WMCA, containing a
wire rage of PAI - 3D, 2D, and partial attacks.
- The
results reported in this work are fully reproducible: experimental database is publicly available, the evaluation protocols are strictly defined, and the source code for replicating
experiments is published
