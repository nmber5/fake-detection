## FaceLiveNet+: A Holistic Networks For Face Authentication Based On Dynamic Multi-task Convolutional Neural Networks

- A multi tasking deep neural network is proposed which performs face verification and facial expression recognition using hard parameter sharing.The initial hidden layers are shared by both the tasks and the task specific layers are branched.
- The weights of both are dynamically learned with training. The final prediction of live or spoof is done by fusing both the results.The Deep CNN used is based on Inception-ResNet.
- Datasets used - Face verification : LFW, YTF,  Face emotion recognition : OULU CASIA, CK+
