## Generalized Presentation Attack Detection: a face anti-spoofing evaluation proposal

- A novel framework for Generalisation in face  PAD is published as a python package named GRAD-GPAD.
- This package provides a common taxonomy of existing databases and allows to evaluate face-PAD algorithms from additional viewpoints. This is scalable and extendable allowing to create new protocols and adding new datasets.
- GRAD-GPAD presents two main stages: i) feature extraction, where features are computed for each input video applying a preprocessing step and following the interface of the Feature Extractor; and ii) evaluation, where a filtering step is applied, using the already extracted features and the common categorization of the datasets, to train and test over the selected features.
- Around 10 of the benchmark public dataset have been integrated and a common evaluation protocol format is designed for all the datasets and the datasets are split accordingly into train, development and test sets.
- An inter dataset categorization is done based on four categories(common capture device, common lighting and common face resolution)
- Various new evaluation protocols are proposed for evaluation.
