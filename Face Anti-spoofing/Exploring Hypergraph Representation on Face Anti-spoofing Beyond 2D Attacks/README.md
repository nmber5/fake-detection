## Exploring Hypergraph Representation on Face Anti-spoofing Beyond 2D Attacks

- Hypergraph CNN with RGB-D information is proposed to counter 3D mask arrack and 2D attacks
- First a compact face representation using only a few key points is proposed which leads to largely reducing time and space complexity and these then are represented on a hypergraph as hypergraph representation is robust to facial motion and facial emotions captured.
- Hypergraph CNNs are designed by extending  the graph CNNs to extract features from the hypergraph representation of faces.
- Both RGB and depth information is exploited for 3d mask anti-spoofing.
- Datasets used - 3DMAD, proposed FA3D(For 3D models), OLLO-NPU for all 2D tests.
