## Exploiting temporal and depth information for multi-frame face anti-spoofing

- This paper explores temporal depth information for spoof vs real detection by combining depth information with temporal motion.
- Optical flow motion is used to track temporal motion and convGRU units are used to incorporate temporal information from both adjacent and long sequence frames.
- A novel depth supervised architecture  with OFF block (OFFB) and ConvGRU module to consider facial depths and their unique motion patterns from temporal information of monocular frame sequences is proposed.
- A contrastive depth loss to learn the topography of facial points for depth supervised face anti-spoofing is proposed.
- Datasets used - OULU-NPU, SiW, CASIA-MFSD, Replay-Attack.
