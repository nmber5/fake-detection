## Time Analysis of Pulse-based Face Anti-Spoofing in Visible and NIR

[CVPR 2018 workshops]

- Present a new dataset of photo attacks with long video sequences, in visible (RGB) and Near
InfraRed (NIR)
- study the performance of video-based
pulse detection depending on the length of the video sequences, both in an existing benchmark (3DMAD) and our
new dataset
- simulate and test pulse-based PAD in a
scenario in which the attacking conditions  vary over time
