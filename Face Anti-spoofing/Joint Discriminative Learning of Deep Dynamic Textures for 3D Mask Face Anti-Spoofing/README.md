## Joint Discriminative Learning of Deep Dynamic Textures for 3D Mask Face Anti-Spoofing

[IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION FORENSICS AND SECURITY]

- We propose a new feature, named deep dynamic texture for 3D mask face anti-spoofing. The proposed feature
exploits the dynamic information of textures from a CNNâ€™s
convolutional layer, and is able to capture subtle facial motion
differences between real faces and masked faces with strong
generalization ability.
- We propose a joint discriminative learning model on
deep dynamic textures. By jointly learning the spatial- and
channel-discriminability to weight the deep dynamic textures
with respect to different spatial regions and feature channels,
the effects of deep dynamic textures with strong discriminability for face/mask classification can be enhanced in terms of
spatial regions and feature channels.
